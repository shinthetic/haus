So I registered this domain and figured I'd throw a site up. It's coming together a bit better than expected... How neat!

Now I hear you, _"Isn't using a house website for your own purposes selfish"_, and I'll say I don't see anyone else lining up make a website.

>_Isn't it a bit basic?_
Maybe a little, but I think it doesn't need to be overly complicated. It should only serve the purposes it's designed for.

>_Is having a website opening us up to further scrutiny in the public eye?_
I don't think it will be noteworthy
