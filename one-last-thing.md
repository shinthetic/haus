Troubling times indeed. They always said it'd be like this. Though, I never expected things to turn out the way they are.

Maybe it's something I've always known. Something hidden in plain sight, but growing until you can't ignore it any longer.

I thought they'd always end up fine in the end, but now I think things might be less fine.

But ultimately, fine in the end. A material matter that matters little.

Every moment has it's merit. Something to be learned... But maybe more could have been done.

Another matter for another.

Willfull wiles woefully whisk me away.

It's a busy time and there's only so much time to give. It's a scarce commodity.

At this point you might be able to tell that I've been rambling. Sometimes my thoughts wander and betray me. 

If you find one in the wild, you would be wise to be wary. I personally wouldn't trust a one without thorough considerarion.

These days are long, but go by so quickly.
So I thought that it would be a waste for these words to scatter into the wind.

Words always escaping me, losing trace of them when I need them most. I misplace all sorts of important things. 

I used to keep a diary of sorts. I never wrote about my day to day events. I just wrote my thoughts and feelings as they came to paper.

~~A lot of crossing things out~~

I don't always mean the things I say or write. It's a bit foolish, because I try to find hidden meanings in other people's words, even if they don't mean it. People really should be more careful with their words.

I joke, ha ha.

There's some humor here.

I appreciate all the consideration
